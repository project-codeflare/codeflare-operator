## Development

### Testing

The e2e tests can be executed locally by running the following commands:

1. Use an existing cluster, or set up a test cluster, e.g.:

    ```bash
    # Create a KinD cluster
    $ kind create cluster --image kindest/node:v1.25.8
    # Install the CRDs
    $ make install
    ```

2. Start the operator locally:

    ```bash
    $ make run
    ```

   Alternatively, You can run the operator from your IDE / debugger.

3. Set up the test CodeFlare stack:

   ```bash
   $ make setup-e2e
   ```

4. In a separate terminal, run the e2e suite:

    ```bash
    $ make test-e2e
    ```

   Alternatively, You can run the e2e test(s) from your IDE / debugger.
