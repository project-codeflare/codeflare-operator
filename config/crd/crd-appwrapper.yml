                                      Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                                      When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                                      Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                                      If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                                      Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                      Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                      tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                      negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
